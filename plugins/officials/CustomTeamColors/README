This plugin makes it possible to customize the team colors applied by SPADS.

The CustomTeamColors.colors.conf file contains colors declarations, associating
each color name with the corresponding color defintion. By default this file
contains all the standard HTML/CSS colors (additional custom colors can be
added there if needed).

The CustomTeamColors.rules.conf file contains the rules to determine the set
of colors which must be used for each team, depending on the battle structure
(number of teams, team sizes...). By default this file only contains one basic
example rule which provides colors for 1v1 to 3v3 games.
As for all table-type SPADS configuration files, the first line is the template
declaration, which indicates all fields which can be used in your rules (these
fields are explained in detail in the file header).
